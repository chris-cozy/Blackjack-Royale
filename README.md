2. Players can choose to hit (get another card) or stand (keep their current hand).
3. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
4. The dealer will automatically hit until their hand value is at least 17.
5. After the dealer's turn, the winner is determined based on the hand values.
